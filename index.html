                <h3>SURPRISING BENEFITS</h3>
                <p>Owning a dog can motivate you to exercise every day. On those days when it might be easy to skip a workout, looking at your dog standing by the door waiting to go for a walk can give you the push you need to get out there. Taking your dog for a 30 minute walk every day can greatly improve your health.

                <h3>FEEL SAFER</h3>
                <p>Dogs can be an effective home security system. Studies show that barking dogs deter burglars. Just knowing that you’ve got a dog who can use its keen sense of hearing to detect anyone prowling around can help increase your sense of security, which is good for both your mental and physical health.

               <h3>DETECT CANCER SOONER</h3>
               <p>A dog’s amazing sense of smell can be used for a variety of purposes, including cancer detection. Many dog owners have reported their dog sniffing, licking, or nudging spots that later turned out to be cancerous. One of the unexpected benefits of having a dog is that it may even save your life by helping you to detect cancer.</p>

                 <h3>Sociability</h3>
                 <p>"Animals have the ability to create connections that transcend racial, cultural, physical and socioeconomic differences,” says Dr Sandra McCune, scientific leader in human-animal interaction at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. “Simply seeing people out walking dogs can also make a neighbourhood feel safer, particularly for women.”</p>

                 <h3>Encouraging Excersise:</h3>
                 <p>Owning a dog can be a real game-changer for activity levels – particularly among elderly people whose exercise opportunities reduce with age. More exercise leads to fewer health problems: an extensive UK study in 1991 showed that new pet owners, when compared with people without pets, increased their exercise and had fewer minor health problems.

                <h3>STRESS BUSTER</h3>
                <p>There have been lots of studies that have shown how dogs decrease stress levels. Petting your dog, playing with your dog, and simply watching your dog can reduce your stress each day. Research shows that dog ownership reduces stress hormones and the effects usually outweigh the stress caused by caring for a dog.

                <img class="col-md-6" src="img/dog.jpg" id="dog" alt="image not found" >
                <p>Many of the studies looking into the benefits of pet ownership took into account differences of wealth and social standing. As a result, the benefits of dog ownership are believed to be connected to the pet directly, and not just linked to having the money and leisure to be able to afford a dog.
                It’s good to know that having a dog is good for you. However, it is not a wise plan to purchase a pet with only these benefits in mind. Remember that the pooch is a living creature with its own physical and emotional needs.You already know how good a friend your dog can be. What you might not have noticed is how much more you talk to other people when you’re out with your dog. You’re simply more likely to interact with other humans when your dog is with you than when you are out for a walk by yourself.Their endless loyalty and love towards you will make yourself feel on cloud nine.They are the ones that make us feel wholesome and stressfree,owning a pet .
